# Tanzania Well Water Functionality Multiclass Classification

![Tanzania Well](well_water.jpg)

## Overview

Water scarcity is a pressing global issue, and access to clean and functional wells is crucial in addressing it. This project leverages machine learning to predict the functionality of wells in Tanzania, helping authorities manage and maintain these essential water sources effectively.

The dataset used in this project is generously provided by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. It contains a wealth of information about well characteristics, geographical data, and historical records of well functionality. Our goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately classifying well functionality into multiple categories, including functional, non-functional, and functional but in need of repair.

## Project Highlights

### Data Analysis and Visualization

Our journey begins with a comprehensive analysis of the dataset. Through exploratory data analysis, we uncover valuable insights into the factors that influence well functionality. We use various data visualization techniques to visualize these relationships, making it easier to interpret the data.

### Handling Imbalanced Data

Dealing with imbalanced data is a common challenge in machine learning. In this project, we address this issue by employing Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN). These techniques help balance the dataset, ensuring that each class is adequately represented.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

The performance of machine learning models heavily relies on hyperparameter settings. To optimize our models, we harness the power of hyperparameter tuning using both OPTUNA and GridSearch. This process fine-tunes the model parameters, leading to improved classification performance.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

We explore a range of classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. By experimenting with various algorithms, we strive to achieve high recall and precision, ensuring that our model accurately predicts well functionality.
